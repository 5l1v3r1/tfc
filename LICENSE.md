###NOTICES
   Since making changes to crypto libraries is generally not a good idea,
   below is documentation that explains why each change was made and how
   they do not weaken security.

   https://github.com/maqp/pynacl/commit/
   a89b862a703353fd536951eea574ef4305030a11#diff-ac3b39a5ab4db5864edbe34708be717d

   Added a getter shared_key() to extract the ECDHE shared secret after key
   exchange; This allows Tx.py to derive two separate symmetric keys using
   PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256: Each key is salted with a different public key. While
   nonce-based crypto would be secure with two parties using the same key, it
   would have no forward secrecy. TFC generates forward secrecy with cyclic
   hashing of key through PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 between every message. Using only
   one key would mean any offset in state of the keys would lead to
   retrospective decryption of messages between the two states, if end-points
   were physically compromised.

   TFC has always included an option for Raspberry Pi and HWRNG generated keys.
   The edit to PrivateKey.generate() allows user to mix in entropy from the
   HWRNG during private key generation. External entropy is XORed with standard
   entropy of the library -- it has no adverse effects and can only add entropy
   to keys.

   Simple proof of this is to assume the external entropy is malicious. It
   could try to generate a keystream based on nacl.utils.random(), aiming to
   produce a final output that is a bit string of zeroes (or any random looking
   predictable string). This is not possible as external entropy is loaded
   before PyNaCl's CSPRNG random() is called.

   Alternatively, the external entropy can be malicious, predictable bit
   sequence that provides no additional entropy. This is in no way different
   from XORing the random() function's output with arbitrary number of times
   with any completely predictable string, e.g. a bit-string of 0s, that has
   no effect on entropy random() returns. Therefore, the external entropy can
   not weaken the overall entropy of key.

   This property is used when no external entropy is provided. In those cases,
   the output random() is in fact XORed with bit-string of zeroes, and it will
   lead to exact same output as that of random(). Since constant time XOR
   operation is performed for every generation time, it introduces practically
   no timing attacks. Also, in the case of TFC, adversary is unable to exploit
   TxM behind data diode to obtain information about when the key generation
   takes place. Adversary who has exploited NH first learns about the key
   generation when NH's serial interface that receives data from TxM loads
   public key packet sent to contact.
